//! pisci-kernel — OS/UI-neutral agent runtime.
//!
//! This crate hosts the parts of OpenPisci that should run identically on
//! Tauri desktop, the headless CLI and any future host. It owns the agent
//! loop, LLM clients, local storage, memory layer, policy, scheduler and the
//! platform-neutral tool implementations.
//!
//! Platform-specific tools (Windows UIA, Chromium browser, PowerShell / WMI /
//! COM, IM gateways) deliberately stay in their host crate and are injected
//! into the kernel via the [`pisci_core::host`] traits.
